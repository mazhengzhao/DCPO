# 🚀 DCPO

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:  
**C²GSPG: Confidence-Calibrated Group Sequence Policy Gradient towards Self-Aware Reasoning.**

## Environment Setup

The code has been successfully tested on **8 × 80GB A100 GPUs** with **CUDA 12.8**.  
To create a Conda environment, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone DCPO
cd DCPO
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
---

## Running the Code

After setting up the environment, run the following command to start training:

```bash
bash examples/Qwen3-8B.sh
```

---

## Evaluating Metrics

To compute evaluation metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**, **Brier Score (BS)** and **Positive Calibration Error (PCE)**, deploy a vllm service of your model, identify your model name and service url and run:

```bash
bash examples/eval.sh
```

The script will log output in folder logs/$model_name/ and plot a calibration curve in Figs/{model_name}.
